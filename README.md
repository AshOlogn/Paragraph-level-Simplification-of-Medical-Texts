rouge_score
nltk
```

### Data
The Cochrane dataset that we used can be found in the `data` directory. To scrape your own dataset from the Cochrane website, run the following command, which creates a directory called `scraped_data` and populates it with the raw dataset `data.json`.
```
python prepare_data/scrape.py
```
Then run the following command to process the raw dataset generated by the above script. It creates a cleaned up and length-filtered version of the original dataset, which can be found at `scraped_data/data_final_1024.json`.
```
python prepare_data/process.py
```
Finally, create a train-val-test split of this dataset by running the following command, which creates the directory `scraped_data/data-1024`, which contains the split data.
```
python prepare_data/split_dataset.py
```
To use this dataset for training or text generation, copy the directory into the `data` folder.

### Train Model
There are 4 different training settings explored in the paper: no unlikelihood training and unlikelihood training with 3 different sets of weights used in the loss function (Cochrane, Newsela, and both). To train a model under one of these settings, run one of the following scripts: `scripts/train/bart-no-ul.sh` or `scripts/bart-ul_{cochrane, newsela, both}.sh`.

### Pretrained Models
The pretrained models corresponding to the 4 training settings can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cIiJeUswacHrP0AnsFwprXk6C7qT-m-A?usp=sharing). To use these models, unzip the directories and place them in the `trained_models` directory. 

### Generate Text
To generate text using trained models, run one of the following scripts: `scripts/gen/bart_gen_{no-ul, cochrane, newsela, both}.sh`. Decoding hyperparameters can be controlled by modifying the command-line arguments listed in the scripts. Both a text and JSON version of the generated text will be written to the directory containing the model (i.e. `trained_models/bart-ul_cochrane`).
