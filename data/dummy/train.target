Different strategies are used to try and prevent this condition, and the review of trials found that some of these are effective. Two interventions, cryotherapy (ice chips) and keratinocyte growth factor (palifermin®) showed some benefit in preventing mucositis. Sucralfate is effective in reducing the severity of mucositis, and a further seven interventions, aloe vera, amifostine, intravenous glutamine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), honey, laser and antibiotic lozenges containing polymixin/tobramycin/amphotericin (PTA) showed weaker evidence of benefit. These were evaluated in patients with different types of cancer, undergoing different types of cancer treatment. Benefits may be restricted to the disease and treatment combinations evaluated.
This review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of intranasal corticosteroids for improving nasal airway obstruction in children aged 0 to 12 years with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy. Evidence derived from five of the six randomised controlled trials included in this review suggests that intranasal steroids may significantly improve symptoms of nasal obstruction in children with adenoidal hypertrophy and that this improvement may be associated with the reduction of adenoid size. One study did not find a significant improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms. Further large and high-quality randomised controlled trials are warranted.
Decisions about whether to participate in randomized trials are made more difficult because of the widespread belief that new treatments must inevitably be superior to existing (standard) treatments. Indeed, it is understandable that people hope that this will be the case. If this was actually so, however, the ethical precondition of uncertainty would often not apply. This Cochrane methodology review addresses this important question: "What is the likelihood that new treatments being compared to established treatments in randomized trials will be shown to be superior?" Four cohorts of consecutive, publicly funded, randomized trials, which altogether included 743 trials that enrolled 297,744 patients, met our inclusion criteria for this review. We found that, on average, new treatments were very slightly more likely to have favorable results than established treatments, both in terms of the primary outcomes targeted and overall survival. In other words, when new treatments are compared with established treatments in randomized trials we can expect slightly more than half will prove to be better, and slightly less than half will prove to be worse than established treatments. This conclusion applies to publicly funded trials as we did not include studies funded by commercial sponsors in our analysis.The results are consistent with the ethical preconditions for random allocation – when people are enrolled in randomized trials, the results cannot be predicted in advance as there is genuine uncertainty about which of the treatments being compared in randomized trials will prove to be superior.
This systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents identified 22 short-term (<= 16 weeks) randomised controlled trials which were eligible for inclusion (2519 participants). Treatment response was significantly greater after treatment with medication (58.1%) than with placebo (31.5%) in 14 trials. Medication was more effective than placebo in reducing overall symptom severity across all of the anxiety disorders (number of studies (N) = 9). The greatest number of trials were for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), for which treatment efficacy in reducing symptom severity was also observed . The greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have used the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). No controlled evidence could be found for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines, despite their continued prescription for paediatric anxiety disorders. Medication was less well tolerated than placebo, as indicated by the significant proportion of children and adolescents who dropped out due to adverse effects during the short term trials. Furthermore, while few incidences of suicidal behaviour/ideation in the included trials were attributed to study medication, it is important to be aware of the need for careful monitoring after initiation of SSRIs in treating this population. In conclusion, medication should be considered as part of the treatment of paediatric anxiety disorders over the short-term. Additional research into the optimal dose and duration of medication treatment, as well as the effects of age on the efficacy and tolerability of medication is warranted.
This systematic review and meta-analysis, which is the first in this field, shows a significant beneficial effect on both overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy after removal of their primary rectal tumour. Further investigation is needed to define the role of postoperative chemotherapy in the multimodal treatment of patients with rectal carcinoma: for instance, modern anti-cancer agents (including so called "smart drugs") and integration with neoadjuvant therapy (such as preoperative chemoradiation) should be taken into consideration in order to improve the encouraging findings of this meta-analysis.
The aim of this review is to compare these two types of treatment. We found four small studies were identified after an extensive literature search. Due to limited information about the design of the studies, and the small number of patients enrolled, the results should be interpreted with caution. Meta-analysis showed lower rates of recurrence in the surgery group, however there was insufficient evidence to draw a strong conclusion. Postoperative complications such as infection and fever, as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group; however the recurrence rate was higher. Cure at short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result which may be as a result of the age of one of the studies and the different agent used compared to the other studies.
This review examines the benefits and costs of outreach in a range of specialties and in a variety of settings. Simple 'shifted outpatients' styles of specialist outreach were shown to improve access, but there was no evidence of their impact on health outcomes. Outreach as part of more complex multifaceted interventions involving primary care collaborations, education and other services was associated with improved health outcomes, more efficient and guideline-consistent care, and less use of inpatient services. There is a need for better quality evidence evaluating specialist outreach in all settings, but especially in rural and disadvantaged populations.
Evidence from this review of 630 people in two trials suggests that, in patients with polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of thrombotic and all-cause mortality. No data were provided on mortality from bleeding episodes. No studies in participants with essential thrombocythaemia and with antiplatelet therapy other than aspirin have been published.
